List of Features / User Stories
This typically will be a short list of the features / user stories that you planned during the development phase of the project

- Use previous and next button for question previews.
- Make large top box to contain questions and pictures.
- Make answer boxes responsive.
- Style font for color and size.
- Make clicking look more obvious.
- Make score number change.
<!-- Try to be a little more descriptive here.  Talk about the font/color/image choices for instance -->

First using HTML I insert Div's into the body. I know I needed multiple boxes and a way to separate the larger question box and the answer boxes. Use a div container to contain all of the smaller boxes.
<!-- Probably dont need this section. You could include something about the javascript functionality as well. -->
